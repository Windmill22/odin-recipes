    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived
        from meat, fish, or vegetables.</p>
    <p>The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of
        fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the
        heat is
        raised to medium-high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly.</p>
