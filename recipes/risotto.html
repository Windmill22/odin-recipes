    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived
        from meat, fish, or vegetables.</p>
    <p>The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of
        fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the
        heat is
        raised to medium-high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g risotto rice</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomato</li>
        <li>1l vegetable stock</li>
        <li>knob of butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make tomato sauce Risotto</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the chopped tomatoes and half the stock into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Pour into a
            saucepan with the
            remaining stock, bring to a gentle simmer and keep over a low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the butter and oil in the base of a large saucepan and heat gently until the butter has
            melted. Add the
            onion and gently cook for 6-8 mins until softened. Stir in the garlic and rosemary, then cook for 1 min
            more. Add the
            rice and cook, stirring, for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Start adding the hot stock and tomato mixture about a quarter at a time. Let the risotto cook, stirring
            often, adding
            more stock as it is absorbed. After you have added half the stock, add the cherry tomatoes. After 20-25
            mins, the rice
            should be creamy and tender, the cherry tomatoes softened and all of the stock should be used up.</li>

        <li>Cover and leave for 1 min, then stir in the basil. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan and a good grinding of
            black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
